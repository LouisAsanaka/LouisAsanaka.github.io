Today, I finally got around to learning how to build iOS applications. I followed Ray Wenderlich's [Beginning Table Views](https://www.raywenderlich.com/5995-beginning-table-views) video course, which placed heavy emphasis on Table Views and introduced many of its features. As it was my first time building a mobile app of any kind, I had to learn certain new concepts such as the [MVC pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) and the [delegation pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern). The goal of the video course was to build a simple todo / checklist app that allowed the user to add, edit, remove, and rearrange their todo tasks. After finishing the course, I am now thinking of making the app persist the todo list items so that the same tasks can be accessed even after app relaunches.
